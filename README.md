PiCode
======

The primary aim of this project is to provide a low cost, multi-room streaming audio solution with an easy to use control system that runs on a low cost hardware platform (e.g. Raspberry Pi). The problem that I aim to solve is that multi-room audio solutions are often expensive, usually involving cable routing and expensive hardware. This solution should be low-cost and simple enough to be installed and used in homes by anyone and configurable enough to be of use in businesses (such as nightclubs, bars and any other business that has a need for a multi-room audio solution).


__This repository is for the Raspberry Pi code, this python application will initially be designed with only Debian (Raspbian at the moment) in mind. The other Repo will house the cloud interface code and can be found [Here](http://github.com/PiSync/CloudCode)__

__Please Note: Feel free to Fork this repo, but as this is a University Dissertation project, no pull requests will be merged until the marking process has been completed (this should be around July 2014).__
